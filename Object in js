Title: Exploring Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript


<!-- Creating Objects: -->

There are multiple ways to create objects in JavaScript. The most common approach is by using object literals, denoted by curly braces:


const person = {
  name: 'Raghu',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Web Developer'
};


In the example above, we create an object called `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `occupation`. Each property is assigned a value using the colon (`:`) notation.


Accessing and Manipulating Object Properties:
To access properties of an object, we can use dot notation or square brackets. For example:


console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30



We can also modify existing properties or add new ones dynamically:

person.age = 31;
person.gender = 'Male';


<!-- Object Methods: -->

Objects in JavaScript can also have methods, which are functions stored as properties. These methods allow us to define behaviors or actions that an object can perform. Here's an example:


const car = {
  brand: 'Tesla',
  model: 'Model S',
  start: function() {
    console.log('The car is starting.');
  },
  stop: function() {
    console.log('The car is stopping.');
  }
};

car.start(); // Output: 'The car is starting.'
car.stop(); // Output: 'The car is stopping.'
